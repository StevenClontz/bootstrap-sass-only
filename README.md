# Bootstrap SASS only

It's [bootstrap-css-only][0], but with SCSS from [bootstrap-sass][1].
(Note: fonts are not distributed with this repository)

## Why?

I wanted to use Bootstrap with SASS, but I don't want a jQuery dependency
since I'm using AngularJS. See [bootstrap-css-only][0].

## Installation:

`bower install bootstrap-sass-only`
